Hello to anyone reading this- 

This is a website created for the sole purpose of my Master's degree course in Process and Modeling Analysis.
I will be going in depth to provide a website with satisfactory needs for the goal of achieving a Professinal level Website. Currently this is version 2 of the website and updated weekly with new add-ons.
